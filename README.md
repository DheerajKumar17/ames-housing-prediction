🏠 Ames Housing Price Prediction
A comprehensive machine learning project to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset, achieving 88% accuracy with advanced feature engineering.

📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow including data cleaning, feature engineering, and model comparison to predict residential property values in Ames, Iowa.

Key Results:
Best Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
R² Score: 0.8800 (88% accuracy)
Dataset: 2,930 houses with 82+ features
Key Discovery: Quality × Size interaction accounts for 85.8% of predictive power

🎯 Business Problem
Real estate pricing requires understanding multiple factors that influence property values. This project identifies the most important features and creates a predictive model for accurate house price estimation.

📈 Key Findings
Premium Features Impact
Pool: +$XXX,XXX average price premium
Garage: 94.6% of houses have garages
Basement: 97.3% of houses have basements
Fireplace: 51.5% of houses have fireplaces

Top 5 Price Drivers:
Quality_SF_Interaction (85.8%) - Our engineered feature combining house quality and size
Total_Bathrooms (3.2%) - Total bathroom count including half baths
Year Built (2.7%) - House construction year
Garage Area (2.1%) - Garage square footage
Total Basement SF (1.6%) - Basement area

🔧 Technical Approach

Data Cleaning:
Handled 15,749+ missing values strategically
Converted missing premium features to binary indicators
Fixed data quality issues (negative house ages, outliers)

Feature Engineering
python
# Key engineered features
df['Quality_SF_Interaction'] = df['Overall Qual'] * df['Total_SF']
df['Total_Bathrooms'] = df['Full Bath'] + df['Half Bath'] * 0.5 + df['Bsmt Full Bath'] + df['Bsmt Half Bath'] * 0.5
df['Has_Premium_Feature'] = (df['Premium_Feature'].notnull()).astype(int)

🔍 Key Insights
Feature Engineering Success:
Our engineered Quality_SF_Interaction feature became the single most important predictor, showing that high-quality large houses command premium prices.

Premium Amenities Matter
Houses with pools, garages, and basements command significant price premiums, validating real estate market intuitions.

Model Performance
Gradient Boosting's superior performance (R² = 0.8800) demonstrates the value of ensemble methods for complex real estate data.
